# RSA-encryption
An implementation of the asymetric encryption technique RSA in python. The program contains a function for key-pair generation using a **prime number generator**, the Euclidian algorithm for finding the **greatest common divisor** (gcd) and the Euclidian algorithm for finding the **multiplicative inverse** of two numbers. It additionally contains functions for encrypting and decrypting messages based of the public and private keys generated by the aforementioned function.

##Setup
**Requirements**
`python 3.9.6`

**Step 1: Innstall Pip**
The easiest way to install NumPy is by using the package manager Pip. Innstallation instructions for Ubuntu follows:
`sudo apt install python3-pip`

**Step 2: Innstall Numpy**
With Pip set up, you use its command line for installing NumPy:
